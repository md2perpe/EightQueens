Javascript solution of Eight Queens problem


Ideas
-----

* Every row can contain only one queen
* Every column can contain only one queen

Therefore, every solution can be represented as a permutation of the column numbers (0 through 7).

* If two queens can reach each other diagonally, either 'row' + 'col' (for \ diagonals) or 'row' - 'col' (for / diagonals) are equal for the two queens.
